        <p>The blockchain world has evolved quite a bit in recent years. We've gone from <span class="span03">simple
                smart contracts</span> on
            development environments like Ethereum to <span class="span03">Layer 2 solutions</span> that solve
            impossible problems with seeming
            ease. We have taken the initial goal of using blockchain as a solution to the corrupt banking system to a
            level where blockchain is also a solution for dozens of areas, such as <span class="span01">supply chain,
                data storage, and
                identity recognition</span>.</p>

        <p>I never directly developed on Terra or used applications on Terra like Anchor Protocol or Mirror Protocol,
            nevertheless i was invested in the ecosystem and kept up with latest news and developments on the Main Chain
            and in the ecosystem. Even the Bitcoin-UST Swap Engine made for my startup Hinua relied obviously on Terra
            and the UST peg. Loosing money is something very natural, that you have to accept in the crypto world. Not
            only is it, at the current stage of the market, stupid and irresponsible to invest in Altcoins with money
            you can not afford to loose, but it's actually bad for the crypto market because it is affecting the general
            sentiment negatively. Trusting small projects like Anchor Protocol with your life savings is definetlly a
            wrong financial decision. </p>
