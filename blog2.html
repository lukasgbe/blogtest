        <p>In the last few days there has been a big topic in the crypto space: the fall of ="span03">Terra</span> and therefore the rapid fall of $LUNA and the depeg of the stablecoin  <span class="span03">UST.</span> In this short blog, I will briefly present my view and my research on Do Kwan and the LFG Foundation. Nothing here is professional journalism and all information is without guarantee.</p>

        My Affiliations with Terra Luna
    </div>
    <div class="only-text1">
        <p>I never directly developed on Terra or used applications on Terra like Anchor Protocol or Mirror Protocol,
            nevertheless i was invested in the ecosystem and kept up with latest news and developments on the Main Chain
            and in the ecosystem. Even the Bitcoin-UST Swap Engine made for my startup Hinua relied obviously on Terra
            and the UST peg. Loosing money is something very natural, that you have to accept in the crypto world. Not
            only is it, at the current stage of the market, stupid and irresponsible to invest in Altcoins with money
            you can not afford to loose, but it's actually bad for the crypto market because it is affecting the general
            sentiment negatively. Trusting small projects like Anchor Protocol with your life savings is definetlly a
            wrong financial decision. </p>

        Influencer & CEO Do Kwon
    </div>
    <div class="only-text1">
        <p>If I learned one thing in the past years in the blockchain world, it's to never value an asset according to its hype and market sentiment. $LUNA was overvalued heavily in the last bull run and one of the key reasons behind it was the CEO and Co-Founder Do Kwon. Using Twitter as a method to maximize the hype of the project while often down talking  other stablecoin projects like DAI or centralized alternatives (USDT, USDC etc.). Do Kwon had a key role in the death spiral of Terra Luna, since he and the LFG Reserve were controlling all assets that should have helped gaining back normal 1$ peg. </p>
