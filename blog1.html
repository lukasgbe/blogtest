        <p>The blockchain world has evolved quite a bit in recent years. We've gone from <span class="span03">simple
                smart contracts</span> on
            development environments like Ethereum to <span class="span03">Layer 2 solutions</span> that solve
            impossible problems with seeming
            ease. We have taken the initial goal of using blockchain as a solution to the corrupt banking system to a
            level where blockchain is also a solution for dozens of areas, such as <span class="span01">supply chain,
                data storage, and
                identity recognition</span>.</p>
